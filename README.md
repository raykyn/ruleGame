# ruleGame
A text adventure / strategy game with some map generation included.

While most of the will be played in the terminal, there is the option, to visualize the map in HTML.
The python script returns a file that can be used by the HTML page to draw the map.

If you've got any questions about it, feel free to contact me :-)
